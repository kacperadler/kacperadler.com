### üëã Hi, I'm Kacper Adler

![Author image](/images/author/author_250.jpg)

I'm a Frontend Developer from Poland with a passion for aesthetics and work where visual aspects are important. As you can see, this is not applied to this website. Yet üòè

My adventure in software development started in 2020, in the same year I found my first job as a frontend developer. Currently, my favorite library is React and everything around it like NEXT.js or React Native. I'm also interested in WEB3 and the technology behind it.

### ü§î What you can find here?

Basically, everything about Frontend development and React itself, sometimes maybe a piece of knowledge about WEB3. To be more precise here is a list of examples of topics:

- React
- NEXT.js
- React Native
- Useful libraries witch can help you in your projects
- Frontend basics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript or TypeScript
