### ðŸ¥± The boring part - Introduce myself

![Author image](/images/author/author-250.jpg)

I finished school in 2020 and decided to try my hand at college. I didn't want to do it, but I figured if I didn't like it, I could quit, and that's what I did. After 6 months, I quit my studies and focused on programming. My first choice is Python. I really liked this language but something was missing.

In my free time I was learning UX & UI and I liked it, then I combine these two things, passion for programming and love for aesthetics and that's how I started my adventure with Frontend. In 2021 I focus on improving my skills, mainly in React and Typescript. After 4 months of improvement and learning, I found my first job as a Frontend developer.

Currently, my favorite library is React and everything around it like NEXT.js or React Native. I'm also interested in WEB3 and the technology behind it, maybe in the future, you can find something about it here.

### ðŸ¤” Some information - What you can find here?

Basically, everything about Frontend development and React itself, sometimes maybe a piece of knowledge about WEB3. To be more precise here is a list of examples of topics:

- React
- NEXT.js
- React Native
- Useful libraries witch can help you in your projects
- Frontend basics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript or TypeScript

### ðŸ¤“ In the end, letâ€™s grab some knowledge about React
